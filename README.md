POE Final Part 3
I have create a WPF.Net file to graphicaly support the recipe manager console application made in the part of this application.
The WPF has the same functionality from the recipe manager class binded to button for users to interact with
The application supports features like adding, saving, clearing, loading, scaling, viewing, and inserting information in the text fields for the indgredients and steps.
In order for the scaling function to work a user must select a recipe first and in order to view recent recipes enterd a user must click the load button to make sure the task is loaded.
